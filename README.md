# Programming Learning Lab

This repository serves as a practical code reference library for various programming concepts, primarily focused on Python data analysis and machine learning. Rather than containing notes or tutorials, this repository demonstrates concepts through working code examples.

## Purpose

The goal of this repository is to build a collection of clear, well-documented code examples that demonstrate various programming concepts in action. Each file focuses on a single concept and includes:

- A clear, focused example of the concept in use
- Multiple variations showing different use cases
- Common pitfalls and how to avoid them
- Performance considerations where relevant

## Repository Structure

```
programming-learning-lab/
├── pandas/         # Pandas-specific operations and methods
├── machine_learning/            # Machine learning concepts and techniques
├── python_concepts/        # Core Python language features
└── utils/                  # Utility functions and helpers
```

## Example Files

Each example file follows a consistent structure:

1. Imports and setup
2. Sample data creation (when needed)
3. Basic usage example
4. Advanced usage examples
5. Common patterns and idioms
6. Performance tips (where relevant)

Example:
```python
# groupby_examples.py

import pandas as pd

# 1. Basic groupby operation
df = pd.DataFrame({
    'category': ['A', 'A', 'B', 'B'],
    'value': [1, 2, 3, 4]
})
result = df.groupby('category').sum()

# 2. Multiple aggregations
# ... etc.
```

## Contributing

This is a personal learning repository. Each commit represents a new concept learned or an improvement to existing examples. The focus is on creating clear, practical examples that demonstrate real-world usage.

## Learning Path

Current focus areas:
- Pandas operations (groupby, apply, aggregate)
- Multi-index operations
- Machine learning concepts
- Deep learning fundamentals

## Usage

These examples are meant to be:
1. Run independently to see concepts in action
2. Used as reference when implementing similar functionality
3. Modified and experimented with to deepen understanding

Feel free to clone this repository and run the examples locally. Each file is self-contained and includes all necessary setup code.

## Dependencies

Core dependencies for running these examples:
- Python 3.8+
- pandas
- numpy
- scikit-learn
- (additional dependencies will be listed as they're needed)
